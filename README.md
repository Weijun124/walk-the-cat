<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Walk the Cat](./client/public/pictures/Walk-the-cat-screenshot.png)

Cats love the outdoors but have you ever tried to walk your cat on a leash? You may have noticed that the training isn’t so easy and that a fun outing ends up looking something like this...

![Dragging the cat](./client/public/pictures/dragging-the-cat.gif)

Here's why:
 * You weren't using a Walk the Cat Kanban Board!

Walk the Cat's kanban board offers you the perfect tool to plan and track the many tasks you must do to correctly and lovingly train that stubborn cat. Everything from tracking which collar and harness you need to when you must get more treats. <i>Walk the Cat has got your back!</i>

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
